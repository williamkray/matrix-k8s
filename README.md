this repo is meant as a starting point for learning kubernetes, and to grow that knowledge into a persistent,
continuously updated environment for a full matrix stack including:

- synapse
- postgresql
- element
- matrix-media-repo
- nginx
- traefik
- maubot
- mautrix-signal
- prometheus
- grafana
- matrix-registration

bear with me on this journey.
